## Getting Started with NSF ACCESS-CI and Jetstream2

---

### **1. Creating an Account on NSF ACCESS-CI**

**Step 1:** Navigate to the [ACCESS User Registration](https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user) page.

**Step 2:** If you had an XSEDE Portal account, your ACCESS ID is the same. Do not create a new ACCESS ID. Instead, select the “ACCESS CI (XSEDE)” identity provider to log in using your XSEDE account.

**Step 3:** If you don't have an XSEDE or ACCESS account, you have two options:

- [Register with an existing identity](https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user-federated): Use an existing University account to simplify the sign-up process. With this option, creating an ACCESS-specific password is optional.
- [Register without an existing identity](https://identity.access-ci.org/new-user-direct): You'll be prompted to enter all your registration info and select an ACCESS-specific password.

**Step 4:** During registration, ensure you complete the email verification. You'll receive an email from registry@cilogon.org with a URL to complete your registration.

**Note:** Avoid exiting your browser during registration. If you face any issues, please [contact the support team](https://identity.access-ci.org/username-reminder).

### **2. Connecting to Jetstream2**

**Step 1:** Visit the [Jetstream2 official End User documentation](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/ui/).

**Step 2:** Jetstream2 offers multiple interfaces for creating, deploying, and managing Virtual Machines (VMs) and Storage. Familiarize yourself with the available interfaces:

- **Exosphere:** A web-based GUI for VM management.
- **Horizon:** Another web-based GUI with a different set of features.
- **CACAO:** Still in development, but offers unique capabilities.
- **OpenStack CLI:** For those who prefer command-line interfaces.

**Step 3:** For beginners, it's recommended to start with the **Exosphere** interface. Here's a brief guide:

- **Logging In:** Use your ACCESS-CI credentials.
- **Creating an Instance:** Follow the on-screen instructions to deploy a VM.
- **Accessing an Exosphere Instance:** Once your VM is up, you can access it directly from the Exosphere dashboard.

**Step 4:** Dive deeper into the [Jetstream2 documentation](https://docs.jetstream-cloud.org/ui/) to explore advanced features, troubleshooting guides, and more.
