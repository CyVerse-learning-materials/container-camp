5.0 Building your own Containers from scratch
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

In this section we'll go over the creation of Singularity containers
from a recipe file, called `Singularity` (equivalent to `Dockerfile`).

5.1 Keep track of downloaded containers
---------------------------------------

By default, Singularity uses a temporary cache to hold Docker tarballs:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ ls ~/.singularity
```

You can change these by specifying the location of the cache and
temporary directory on your localhost:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ sudo mkdir tmp
$ sudo mkdir scratch

$ SINGULARITY_TMPDIR=$PWD/scratch SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR=$PWD/tmp singularity --debug pull --name ubuntu-tmpdir.sif docker://ubuntu
```

5.2 Building Singularity containers ==================================

Like Docker, which uses a Dockerfile to build its containers,
Singularity uses a file called `Singularity`

When you are building locally, you can name this file whatever you wish,
but a better practice is to put it in a directory and name it
`Singularity` - as this will help later on when developing on
Singularity-Hub and GitHub. Create a container using a custom
Singularity file:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ singularity build ubuntu-latest.sif Singularity
```

We've already covered how you can pull an existing container from Docker
Hub, but we can also build a Singularity container from docker using the
build command:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ sudo singularity build --sandbox ubuntu-latest/  docker://ubuntu

$ singularity shell --writable ubuntu-latest/

Singularity ubuntu-latest.sif:~> apt-get update
```

Does it work?

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ sudo singularity shell ubuntu-latest.sif

Singularity: Invoking an interactive shell within container...

Singularity ubuntu-latest.sif:~> apt-get update
```

When I try to install software to the image without sudo it is denied,
because root is the owner of the container. When I use `sudo` I can
install software to the container. The software remain in the sandbox
container after closing the container and restart.

In order to make these changes permanant, I need to rebuild the sandbox
as a `.sif` image

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
$ sudo singularity build ubuntu-latest.sif ubuntu-latest/
```

Why is creating containers in this way a **bad** idea?

5.2.1: Exercise (\~30 minutes): Create a Singularity file
\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

[SyLabs User-Guide](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/user-guide/)

A `Singularity` file can be hosted on Github and will be auto-detected
by [Singularity-Hub](https://www.singularity-hub.org/) when you set up
your container Collection.

Building your own containers requires that you have sudo privileges -
therefore you'll need to develop these on your local machine or on a VM
that you can gain root access on.

-   **Header**

The top of the file, selects the base OS for the container, just like
`FROM` in Docker.

Bootstrap: references another registry (e.g. `docker` for DockerHub,
`debootstrap`, or `shub` for Singularity-Hub).

`From:` selects the tag name.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
Bootstrap: shub
From: vsoch/hello-world
```

Pulls a container from Singularity Hub (&lt; v2.6.1)

Using debootstrap with a build that uses a mirror:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
BootStrap: debootstrap
OSVersion: xenial
MirrorURL: http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
```

Using a localimage to build:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
Bootstrap: localimage
From: /path/to/container/file/or/directory
```

Using CentOS-like container:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
Bootstrap: yum
OSVersion: 7
MirrorURL: http://mirror.centos.org/centos-7/7/os/x86_64/
Include:yum
```

Note: to use yum to build a container you should be operating on a RHEL
system, or an Ubuntu system with yum installed.

The container registries which Singularity uses are listed in the
[Introduction Section
3.1](https://learning.cyverse.org/projects/container_camp_workshop_2019/en/latest/singularity/singularityintro.html#downloading-pre-built-images).

-   The Singularity file uses sections to specify the dependencies,
    environmental settings, and runscripts when it builds.

The additional sections of a Singularity file include:

-   %help - create text for a help menu associated with your container
-   %setup - executed on the host system outside of the container, after
    the base OS has been installed.
-   %files - copy files from your host system into the container
-   %labels - store metadata in the container
-   %environment - loads environment variables at the time the container
    is run (not built)
-   %post - set environment variables during the build
-   %runscript - executes a script when the container runs
-   %test - runs a test on the build of the container

**Setting up Singularity file system**
======================================

-   **Help**

%help section can be as verbose as you want

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
Bootstrap: docker
From: ubuntu

%help
This is the container help section.
```

-   **Setup**

%setup commands are executed on the localhost system outside of the
container - these files could include necessary build dependencies. We
can copy files to the \$SINGULARITY\_ROOTFS file system can be done
during %setup

-   **Files**

%files include any files that you want to copy from your localhost into
the container.

-   **Post**

%post includes all of the environment variables and dependencies that
you want to see installed into the container at build time.

-   **Environment**

%environment includes the environment variables which we want to be run
when we start the container

-   **Runscript**

%runscript does what it says, it executes a set of commands when the
container is run.

**Example Singularity file**
----------------------------

Example Singularity file bootstrapping a
[Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu/) Ubuntu (16.04) image.

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
BootStrap: docker
From: ubuntu:18.04

%post
   apt-get -y update
   apt-get -y install fortune cowsay lolcat

%environment
   export LC_ALL=C
   export PATH=/usr/games:$PATH

%runscript
   fortune | cowsay | lolcat

%labels
   Maintainer Tyson Swetnam
   Version v0.1
```

Build the container:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
singularity build cowsay.sif Singularity
```

Run the container:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
singularity run cowsay.sif
```

<div class="admonition note">

If you build a squashfs container, it is immutable (you cannot
--writable edit it)
