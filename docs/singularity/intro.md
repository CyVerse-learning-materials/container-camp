In this section we're going to be working with [Singularity Community Edition (CE)](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.9/user-guide/index.html){target=_blank} 

??? Question "Wait, what is "Apptainer", and what is the difference between SingularityCE and Apptainer?"

    The Singularity project was split into multiple projects managed by different organizations since it was created in 2017.

    In a nutshell:

    - Greg Kurtzer founded the Singularity project while at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
    - Kurtzer created [Sylabs](https://sylabs.io/){target=_blank}, a private company, around Singularity 
    - Kurtzer left Sylabs to focus on [CIQ](https://ciq.co/){target=_blank}, another private company, and moved Singularity to [HPCng](https://hpcng.org/){target=_blank} (a Community Org)
    - [Sylabs forked Singularity](https://sylabs.io/singularityce-community-update/){target=_blank} for control and professionially licensed support creating Singularity Community Edition"
    - HPCng gave the official project to Linux Foundation and renamed it "[Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/){target=_blank}
    - Apptainer is being [marketed by CIQ](https://ciq.co/apptainer/){target=_blank}

    At the present time, Apptainer and Singularity CE have highly similar syntax and will run Singularity `.sif` images interoperably

??? info "Docker vs SingularityCE & Apptainer"

    **:material-open-source-initiative: Apptainer and SingularityCE are 100% compatible with Docker but they do have some distinct differences**


    **:material-docker: Docker**
      
    :octicons-container-24: Docker containers run as `root`

      -  This privilege is almost never supported by administrators of High Performance Computing (HPC) centers. Meaning Docker is not, and will likely never be, installed natively on your HPC cluster.

    :octicons-container-24: uses compressed layers to create one image

    **:material-open-source-initiative: SingularityCE & Apptainer**:

    :octicons-container-24:  Same user and group identity inside as outside the container
    
    :octicons-container-24:  User only has `root` privileges if elevated with `sudo when` the container is run
    
    :octicons-container-24:  Can run and modify any existing Docker image

      - These key differences allow Singularity to be installed on most HPC centers. Because you can run virtually all Docker containers in Singularity, you can effectively run Docker on an HPC. 

## SingularityCE Installation

Sylabs Singularity Community Edition (CE) homepage: [https://www.sylabs.io/docs/](https://www.sylabs.io/docs/){target=_blank}

Apptainer Linux Foundation homepage: [https://apptainer.org/](https://apptainer.org/){target=_blank}

### Install Locally

To Install Singularity follow the instructions for your specific OS: <https://sylabs.io/guides/3.9/user-guide/quick_start.html>{target=_blank}

### Module loading on HPC

If you are interested in working with SingularityCE on HPC, you may need to contact your systems administrator and request they install [SingularityCE](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.9/user-guide/quick_start.html#installation-request){target=_blank}. Because SingularityCE ideally needs setuid, your admins may have some qualms about giving SingularityCE this privilege. If that is the case, you might consider forwarding [this letter](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.9/user-guide/quick_start.html#Singularity-on-a-shared-resource){target=_blank} to your admins.

Most HPC systems are running Environment Modules with the simple command `module`.

You can check to see what is available:

```
$ module avail singularity
```

If Singularity is listed as being installed, load a specific version, e.g.:

```
$ module load singularity/3/3.9
```

### Install in CodeSpaces

Follow the instructions for an Ubuntu installation: https://sylabs.io/guides/3.9/user-guide/quick_start.html#install-system-dependencies

Type in the following in a web shell or `ssh` terminal.

```
# Ensure repositories are up-to-date
sudo apt-get update
# Install debian packages for dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y \
   build-essential \
   libseccomp-dev \
   pkg-config \
   squashfs-tools \
   cryptsetup
```

`Go` lang is already installed on your CodeSpace, but you can check to be certain:

```
go --version
```

Install SingularityCE

```
export VERSION=3.9.5 && # adjust this as necessary \
    wget https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/download/v${VERSION}/singularity-ce-${VERSION}.tar.gz && \
    tar -xzf singularity-ce-${VERSION}.tar.gz && \
    cd singularity-ce-${VERSION}

# make build the installation
./mconfig && \
    make -C builddir && \
    sudo make -C builddir install
```

Check the installation with:

```
$ singularity pull shub://vsoch/hello-world
INFO:    Downloading shub image
 59.75 MiB / 59.75 MiB [=====================================================================================================] 100.00% 49.24 MiB/s 1s
tswetnam@tysons-box:~$ singularity run hello-world_latest.sif
RaawwWWWWWRRRR!! Avocado!
```

## Singularity CLI

Singularityâ€™s [command line interface](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.9/user-guide/cli.html){target=_blank} allows you to build and interact with containers transparently. You can run programs inside a container as if they were running on your host system. You can easily redirect IO, use pipes, pass arguments, and access files, sockets, and ports on the host system from within a container.

### :octicons-container-24: help

The `help` command gives an overview of Singularity options and
subcommands as follows:

```
 $ singularity help pull
Pull an image from a URI

Usage:
  singularity pull [pull options...] [output file] <URI>

Description:
  The 'pull' command allows you to download or build a container from a given
  URI. Supported URIs include:

  library: Pull an image from the currently configured library
      library://user/collection/container[:tag]

  docker: Pull a Docker/OCI image from Docker Hub, or another OCI registry.
      docker://user/image:tag
    
  shub: Pull an image from Singularity Hub
      shub://user/image:tag

  oras: Pull a SIF image from an OCI registry that supports ORAS.
      oras://registry/namespace/image:tag

  http, https: Pull an image using the http(s?) protocol
      https://library.sylabs.io/v1/imagefile/library/default/alpine:latest

Options:
      --arch string      architecture to pull from library (default "amd64")
      --dir string       download images to the specific directory
      --disable-cache    dont use cached images/blobs and dont create them
      --docker-login     login to a Docker Repository interactively
  -F, --force            overwrite an image file if it exists
  -h, --help             help for pull
      --library string   download images from the provided library
      --no-cleanup       do NOT clean up bundle after failed build, can be
                         helpful for debugging
      --no-https         use http instead of https for docker:// oras://
                         and library://<hostname>/... URIs


Examples:
  From Sylabs cloud library
  $ singularity pull alpine.sif library://alpine:latest

  From Docker
  $ singularity pull tensorflow.sif docker://tensorflow/tensorflow:latest

  From Shub
  $ singularity pull singularity-images.sif shub://vsoch/singularity-images

  From supporting OCI registry (e.g. Azure Container Registry)
  $ singularity pull image.sif oras://<username>.azurecr.io/namespace/image:tag


For additional help or support, please visit https://www.sylabs.io/docs/
```


### :octicons-container-24: search

Just like with Docker, you can `search` the Singularity container registries for images.

```
singularity search tensorflow
```

### :octicons-container-24: pull

The easiest way to use a Singularity is to `pull` an existing container
from one of the Registries.

```
singularity pull library://lolcow
```

```
singularity pull docker://<yourusername>/cowsay
```

#### Downloading pre-built images

You can use the `pull` command to download pre-built images from a
number of Container Registries, here we'll be focusing on the
[Singularity-Hub](https://www.singularity-hub.org) or
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).

Container Registries:

-   `library://` - images hosted on Sylabs Cloud
-   `docker://` - images hosted on Docker Hub
-   `localimage://` - images saved on your machine
-   `yum://` - yum based systems such as CentOS and Scientific Linux
-   `debootstrap://` - apt based systems such as Debian and Ubuntu
-   `arch://` - Arch Linux
-   `busybox://` - BusyBox
-   `zypper://` - zypper based systems such as Suse and OpenSuse

-   `shub://` - (archived) images hosted on Singularity Hub, no longer maintained

### Pulling an image from Singularity Hub

Similar to previous example, in this example I am pulling a base Ubuntu
container from Singularity-Hub:

```
$ singularity pull shub://singularityhub/ubuntu
WARNING: Authentication token file not found : Only pulls of public images will succeed
88.58 MiB / 88.58 MiB [===============================================================================================] 100.00% 31.86 MiB/s 2s
```

You can rename the container using the --name flag:

```
$ singularity pull --name ubuntu_test.simg shub://singularityhub/ubuntu
WARNING: Authentication token file not found : Only pulls of public images will succeed
88.58 MiB / 88.58 MiB [===============================================================================================] 100.00% 35.12 MiB/s 2s
```

The above command will save the alpine image from the Container Library
as `alpine.sif`

### Pulling an image from Docker Hub

This example pulls an `ubuntu:16.04` image from DockerHub and saves it
to the working directory.

```
$ singularity pull docker://ubuntu:20.04

```

!!! Warning

    Pulling Docker images reduces reproducibility. If you were to pull a
    Docker image today and then wait six months and pull again, you are not
    guaranteed to get the same image. If any of the source layers has
    changed the image will be altered. If reproducibility is a priority for
    you, try building your images from the Container Library.

### Pulling an image from Sylabs cloud library

Letâ€™s use an easy example of `alpine.sif` image from the [container
library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/)

!!! Tip
    You can use `singularity search <name>` command to locate groups,
    collections, and containers of interest on the Container Library

## Interact with images

You can interact with images in several ways such as `shell`, `exec` and
`run`.

For these examples we will use a `cowsay_latest.sif` image that can be
pulled from the Docker Hub.

```
$ singularity pull docker://tswetnam/cowsay
INFO:    Downloading library image
 67.00 MiB / 67.00 MiB [=====================================================================================================] 100.00% 5.45 MiB/s 12s
WARNING: unable to verify container: cowsay_latest.sif
WARNING: Skipping container verification

$ sudo singularity run cowsay_latest.sif
 ________________________________________
/ Expect a letter from a friend who will \
\ ask a favor of you.                    /
 ----------------------------------------
    \   ^__^
     \  (oo)\_______
        (__)\       )\/\
        ||----w |
        ||     ||
```

### :octicons-container-24: shell

The `shell` command allows you to spawn a new shell within your
container and interact with it as though it were a small virtual
machine.

```
$ singularity shell cowsay_latest.sif
  Singularity cowsay_latest.sif:~>
```

The change in prompt indicates that you have entered the container
(though you should not rely on that to determine whether you are in
container or not).

Once inside of a Singularity container, you are the same user as you are
on the host system.

```
$ Singularity cowsay_latest.sif:~> whoami
tswetnam
```

!!! Warning
    `shell` also works with the library://, docker://, and shub:// URIs.
    This creates an ephemeral container that disappears when the shell is
    exited.


### :octicons-container-24: exec

The exec command allows you to execute a custom command within a
container by specifying the image file. For instance, to execute the
`cowsay` program within the cowsay\_latest.sif container:

```
$ singularity exec cowsay_latest.sif cowsay container camp rocks
______________________
< container camp rocks >
 ----------------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

`exec` also works with the library://, docker://, and shub:// URIs. 

```
singularity exec library://lolcow container camp 2022
```

This  creates an ephemeral container that executes a command and disappears.

### :octicons-container-24: run

Singularity containers contain
[runscripts](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/definition_files.html#runscript).
These are user defined scripts that define the actions a container
should perform when someone runs it. The runscript can be triggered with
the `run` command, or simply by calling the container as though it were
an executable.

```
singularity run lolcow_latest.sif

```

### :octicons-container-24: inspect

The `inspect` command will provide information about labels, metadata, and environmental variables.

```
singularity inspect lolcow.sif
```

```
singularity inspect library://lolcow
```

### :octicons-container-24: build

See [Next Section](../singularity/advanced.md) for details of `build`
