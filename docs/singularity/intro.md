# Introduction to Singularity

## 1. Prerequisites

There are no specific skills needed beyond a basic comfort with the
command line and using a text editor. Prior experience installing Linux
applications could be helpful but is not required.

!!! Note
    *Important*: [Singularity is compatible with
    Docker](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.8/user-guide/singularity_and_docker.html),
    but they do have distinct differences.

  Key Differences:

  **Docker**:

  -   Inside a Docker container the user has escalated privileges,
      effectively making them root on that host system. This privilege
      is not supported by *most* administrators of High Performance
      Computing (HPC) centers. Meaning that Docker is not, and will
      likely never be, installed natively on your HPC.

  **Singularity**:

  -   Same user inside as outside the container
  -   User only has root privileges if elevated with sudo when
      container is run
  -   Can run (and modify!) existing Docker images and containers

These key differences allow Singularity to be installed on most HPC
centers. Because you can run virtually all Docker containers in
Singularity, you can effectively run Docker on an HPC.

## 2. Singularity Installation

Sylabs Singularity Community Edition (CE) homepage:
[<https://www.sylabs.io/docs/>](https://www.sylabs.io/docs/)

Singularity is more likely to be used on a remote system that you
don't have control of (i.e. HPC & HTC).

### 2.1 Install Singularity on Laptop

To Install Singularity follow the instructions for your specific OS:
<https://sylabs.io/guides/3.8/user-guide/quick_start.html>

### 2.2 HPC

Load the Singularity module on HPC

If you are interested in working on HPC, you may need to contact your
systems administrator and request they install
[Singularity](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.8/user-guide/quick_start.html#installation-request).
Because singularity ideally needs setuid, your admins may have some
qualms about giving Singularity this privilege. If that is the case, you
might consider forwarding [this letter](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.8/user-guide/quick_start.html#Singularity-on-a-shared-resource)
to your admins.

Most HPC systems are running Environment Modules with the simple command
module.

You can check to see what is available:

```
$ module avail singularity
```

If Singularity is installed, load a specific version:

```
$ module load singularity/3/3.7.2
```

### 2.3 Atmosphere Cloud

CyVerse staff have deployed an Ansible playbook called `ez` for software
installation which includes
[Singularity](https://cyverse-ez-quickstart.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/#).
This command only requires you to type a short line of code to install
an entire software stack with all of its dependencies.

Start any *Featured* instance on Atmosphere `../cyverse/boot.html`

Type in the following in a web shell or `ssh` terminal.

```
$ ezs -r 3.7.3
DEBUG: set version to 3.7.3

* Updating ez singularity and installing singularity (this may take a few minutes, coffee break!)
Cloning into '/opt/cyverse-ez-singularity'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 24, done.
remote: Total 24 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 24
Unpacking objects: 100% (24/24), done.
* ez singularity or singularity itself may not have updated successfully, but you can probably try executing it

To test singularity, type: singularity run shub://vsoch/hello-world
Hint: it should output "RaawwWWWWWRRRR!!")
```

### 2.4 Check Installation

Singularity should now be installed on your laptop or VM, or loaded on
the HPC, you can check the installation with:

```
$ singularity pull shub://vsoch/hello-world
INFO:    Downloading shub image
 59.75 MiB / 59.75 MiB [=====================================================================================================] 100.00% 49.24 MiB/s 1s
tswetnam@tysons-box:~$ singularity run hello-world_latest.sif
RaawwWWWWWRRRR!! Avocado!
```

Singularity’s command line interface allows you to build and interact
with containers transparently. You can run programs inside a container
as if they were running on your host system. You can easily redirect IO,
use pipes, pass arguments, and access files, sockets, and ports on the
host system from within a container.

The help command gives an overview of Singularity options and
subcommands as follows:

```

```
$ singularity help pull
Pull an image from a URI

Usage:
  singularity pull [pull options...] [output file] <URI>

Description:
  The 'pull' command allows you to download or build a container from a given
  URI. Supported URIs include:

  library: Pull an image from the currently configured library
      library://user/collection/container[:tag]

  docker: Pull an image from Docker Hub
      docker://user/image:tag

  shub: Pull an image from Singularity Hub
      shub://user/image:tag

  oras: Pull a SIF image from a supporting OCI registry
      oras://registry/namespace/image:tag

  http, https: Pull an image using the http(s?) protocol
      https://library.sylabs.io/v1/imagefile/library/default/alpine:latest

Options:
      --arch string      architecture to pull from library (default "amd64")
      --dir string       download images to the specific directory
      --disable-cache    dont use cached images/blobs and dont create them
      --docker-login     login to a Docker Repository interactively
  -F, --force            overwrite an image file if it exists
  -h, --help             help for pull
      --library string   download images from the provided library
             (default "https://library.sylabs.io")
      --no-cleanup       do NOT clean up bundle after failed build, can be
             helpul for debugging
      --nohttps          do NOT use HTTPS with the docker:// transport
             (useful for local docker registries without a
             certificate)


Examples:
  From Sylabs cloud library
  $ singularity pull alpine.sif library://alpine:latest

  From Docker
  $ singularity pull tensorflow.sif docker://tensorflow/tensorflow:latest

  From Shub
  $ singularity pull singularity-images.sif shub://vsoch/singularity-images

  From supporting OCI registry (e.g. Azure Container Registry)
  $ singularity pull image.sif oras://<username>.azurecr.io/namespace/image:tag

```

## 3. Downloading pre-built images

The easiest way to use a Singularity is to `pull` an existing container
from one of the Registries.

You can use the `pull` command to download pre-built images from a
number of Container Registries, here we'll be focusing on the
[Singularity-Hub](https://www.singularity-hub.org) or
[DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/).

Container Registries:

-   library - images hosted on Sylabs Cloud
-   shub - images hosted on Singularity Hub
-   docker - images hosted on Docker Hub
-   localimage - images saved on your machine
-   yum - yum based systems such as CentOS and Scientific Linux
-   debootstrap - apt based systems such as Debian and Ubuntu
-   arch - Arch Linux
-   busybox - BusyBox
-   zypper - zypper based systems such as Suse and OpenSuse

### 3.1 Pulling an image from Singularity Hub

Similar to previous example, in this example I am pulling a base Ubuntu
container from Singularity-Hub:

```
$ singularity pull shub://singularityhub/ubuntu
WARNING: Authentication token file not found : Only pulls of public images will succeed
88.58 MiB / 88.58 MiB [===============================================================================================] 100.00% 31.86 MiB/s 2s
```

You can rename the container using the --name flag:

```
$ singularity pull --name ubuntu_test.simg shub://singularityhub/ubuntu
WARNING: Authentication token file not found : Only pulls of public images will succeed
88.58 MiB / 88.58 MiB [===============================================================================================] 100.00% 35.12 MiB/s 2s
```

The above command will save the alpine image from the Container Library
as `alpine.sif`

### 3.2 Pulling an image from Docker Hub

This example pulls an `ubuntu:16.04` image from DockerHub and saves it
to the working directory.

```
$ singularity pull docker://ubuntu:20.04

INFO:    Creating SIF file...
INFO:    Build complete: ubuntu_20.04.sif
```

!!! Warning
    Pulling Docker images reduces reproducibility. If you were to pull a
    Docker image today and then wait six months and pull again, you are not
    guaranteed to get the same image. If any of the source layers has
    changed the image will be altered. If reproducibility is a priority for
    you, try building your images from the Container Library.

### 3.3 Pulling an image from Sylabs cloud library

Let’s use an easy example of `alpine.sif` image from the [container
library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library/)

!!! Tip
    You can use `singularity search <name>` command to locate groups,
    collections, and containers of interest on the Container Library

## 4. Interact with images

You can interact with images in several ways such as `shell`, `exec` and
`run`.

For these examples we will use a `cowsay_latest.sif` image that can be
pulled from the Container Library like so.

```
$ singularity pull library://tyson-swetnam/default/cowsay
INFO:    Downloading library image
 67.00 MiB / 67.00 MiB [=====================================================================================================] 100.00% 5.45 MiB/s 12s
WARNING: unable to verify container: cowsay_latest.sif
WARNING: Skipping container verification

tswetnam@tysons-box:~$ singularity run cowsay_latest.sif
 ________________________________________
/ Expect a letter from a friend who will \
\ ask a favor of you.                    /
 ----------------------------------------
    \   ^__^
     \  (oo)\_______
        (__)\       )\/\
        ||----w |
        ||     ||
```

### 4.1 Shell

The `shell` command allows you to spawn a new shell within your
container and interact with it as though it were a small virtual
machine.

```
$ singularity shell cowsay_latest.sif
  Singularity cowsay_latest.sif:~>
```

The change in prompt indicates that you have entered the container
(though you should not rely on that to determine whether you are in
container or not).

Once inside of a Singularity container, you are the same user as you are
on the host system.

```
$ Singularity cowsay_latest.sif:~> whoami
tswetnam
```

!!! Warning
    `shell` also works with the library://, docker://, and shub:// URIs.
    This creates an ephemeral container that disappears when the shell is
    exited.


### 4.2 Executing commands

The exec command allows you to execute a custom command within a
container by specifying the image file. For instance, to execute the
`cowsay` program within the cowsay\_latest.sif container:

```
$ singularity exec cowsay_latest.sif cowsay container camp rocks
______________________
< container camp rocks >
 ----------------------
        \   ^__^
         \  (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||
```

!!! Note
    `exec` also works with the library://, docker://, and shub:// URIs. This
    creates an ephemeral container that executes a command and disappears.

### 4.3 Running a container

Singularity containers contain
[runscripts](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/definition_files.html#runscript).
These are user defined scripts that define the actions a container
should perform when someone runs it. The runscript can be triggered with
the `run` command, or simply by calling the container as though it were
an executable.

```
singularity run lolcow_latest.sif

```

#### Exercise - 1

Here are the brief steps:

1.  Go to [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/) and look for a Dockerhub
    image
2.  Use `singularity pull` command to pull the Docker image and convert
    it to .sif
3.  Use `singularity run` command to launch a container from the Docker
    image and check to see if you get the same output that as you get
    from running `docker run`

### 4.3 Running a container on HPC

For running a container on HPC, you need to have Singularity module
available on HPC. Let's first look to see if the Singularity module is
available on HPC or not

!!! Warning
  The following instructions are from running on UA HPC. It may or may not
  work on other HPC. Please refer to HPC documentation to find similar
  commands

You can see that there are three different versions of Singularity are
available. For this workshop, we will use `singularity/3/3.5.3`. Let's
load it now

```
$ module load singularity/3/3.5.3
```
