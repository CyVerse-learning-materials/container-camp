**Learning objectives**
======================

- Understand what containers are and their role in reproducible science
- Find and deploy existing containers using CyVerse VICE (Visual Interactive Compute Environment)
- Learn to create Docker containers using your own data and/or analyses for reproducible analysis
- Know the role of the Dockerfile in the build
- Apply Linux command line skills to write Docker files



.. **FAIR Data principles** commented out for intro to container camp
.. =======================

.. Container Camp supports FAIR data principles by providing services that help make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. Participants will get an introduction to containers and learn how to create and manage containers, enabling interoperability and reusability of data.


**Who should attend?**

Faculty, researchers, postdocs, and graduate students who use and analyze data of all types (genomics, astronomy, image data, Big Data, etc.).

**Workshop level**

This workshop is focused on beginner-level users with little to no previous container experience.

.. Intermediate and advanced users who attend will gain a better understanding of and ability with container capabilities  and resources, including deploying their own tools and extending these analyses into Cloud and HPC.
