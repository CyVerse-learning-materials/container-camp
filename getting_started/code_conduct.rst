**Code of Conduct**
=================

All attendees, speakers, staff and volunteers at Container Camp are required to follow our code of conduct. 

CyVerse expects and appreciates cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe, collaborative environment for everyone. Harrassment by any individual will not be tolerated and may result in the individual being removed from the Camp.

Harassment includes: offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants who are asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Workshop staff are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, staff should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. 

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the workshop organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the workshop with no refund.

If you are being harassed, or notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the workshop staff immediately. Staff can be identified as they'll be wearing badges or nametags.

Workshop staff will be happy to help participants contact local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the workshop. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and workshop venues and conference-related social events.
